              You can reinvest your fixed-term deposit either with the same bank or with another partner bank at the current interest rates. This can be done either automatically or manually, if you wish, to continue to benefit from attractive terms.

              If interest rates have fallen or your financial plans have changed, it may be wise to consider alternative investment options, such as a combination of call money for flexibility and fixed-term deposits for stable interest rates.

        <div className="space-y-6">
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            Despite recent interest rate cuts, savers are currently seeing little interest on their current accounts. 
            This situation is further exacerbated by inflation, which reached 2.2% in 2024, above the European 
            Central Bank's (ECB) target of 2.0%.
          </p>
          
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            Rising prices mean that savings gradually lose purchasing power. To counteract this loss of value, call 
            or fixed-term deposit accounts offer the opportunity to invest money at attractive interest rates. 
            Current interest rates for call money are up to 3.35% per annum.
          </p>
          
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            and for fixed-term deposits, depending on the term, up to 3.50% pa.
          </p>
          
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            If the interest gains achieved are higher in percentage terms than the current inflation rate or at least 
            approximately offset it, savers can limit the loss of purchasing power of their savings.
